    3.	Set Up Version Control:
        •	Initialize a Git repository.
        •	Use platforms like GitHub or GitLab for collaboration and code management.

Phase 2: Set Up Development Environment

    1.	Back-End Setup:
        •	Install Python and set up a virtual environment.
        •	Install Django and Django Rest Framework.
        •	Configure PostgreSQL database.
    2.	Front-End Setup:
        •	Install Node.js and npm.
        •	Initialize a React Native project.
        •	Set up directory structure for components, screens, and assets.

Phase 3: Implement Authentication and User Profiles

    1.	Back-End:
        •	Use Django AllAuth for handling authentication.
        •	Create APIs for registration, login, and profile management.
        •	Set up JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API communication.
    2.	Front-End:
        •	Build screens for signup, login, and profile setup.
        •	Implement form validation and error handling.
        •	Integrate with back-end APIs for authentication.

Phase 4: Calibration Process

    1.	Back-End:
        •	Create models for storing user preferences, photo ratings, and interest ratings.
        •	Develop APIs to submit and retrieve calibration data.
    2.	Front-End:
        •	Develop rating mechanics for photo and interest (1 to 5 stars).
        •	Ensure the process is engaging and intuitive.

Phase 5: Matchmaking Engine

    1.	Back-End:
        •	Implement AI models for compatibility scoring:
        •	Use pre-trained models.
        •	Compute interest embeddings.
        •	Store embeddings in the vector database.
        •	Set up batch processing with Celery:
        •	Configure tasks for matchmaking to run at scheduled intervals.
        •	Implement logic for reciprocal score calculation and fallback mechanisms.
    2.	Database Optimization:
        •	Ensure efficient querying and indexing.
        •	Set up caching mechanisms with Redis.

Phase 6: Messaging Functionality

    1.	Back-End:
        •	Create models for conversations and messages.
        •	Enforce rules: one initial message, unlock full chat upon reply.
        •	Use Django Channels for real-time updates (optional at MVP).
    2.	Front-End:
        •	Develop chat interfaces.
        •	Handle sending and receiving messages.
        •	Implement message status indicators (sent, received).

Phase 7: Notifications

    1.	Back-End:
        •	Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.
        •	Implement server-side logic to trigger notifications for new matches and messages.
    2.	Front-End:
        •	Request notification permissions.
        •	Handle incoming notifications and navigate users to relevant screens.

Phase 8: Location Preferences

    1.	Back-End:
        •	Update user models to include location data.
        •	Implement geolocation services and APIs.
        •	Enforce rules for free and premium users.
    2.	Front-End:
        •	Allow users to set and update their location.
        •	Integrate maps or location pickers if necessary.

Phase 9: UI/UX Refinements

    1.	Design Consistency:
        •	Ensure all screens adhere to the design guidelines.
        •	Optimize for different device sizes and orientations.
    2.	Accessibility:
        •	Implement features like screen reader support and high-contrast modes.

Phase 10: Testing and Quality Assurance

    1.	Write Unit and Integration Tests:
        •	Use frameworks like PyTest for back-end testing.
        •	Use Jest and React Native Testing Library for front-end tests.
    2.	User Testing:
        •	Conduct beta testing with a small group.
        •	Collect feedback and iterate on features.

Phase 11: Deployment

    1.	Back-End Deployment:
        •	Containerize the application using Docker.
        •	Deploy on cloud services (AWS ECS, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Heroku for simplicity).
    2.	Front-End Deployment:
        •	Prepare builds for iOS.
        •	Test builds on real devices.
        •	Submit to App Store (follow their guidelines for approval).

Phase 12: Monitoring and Analytics

    1.	Set Up Monitoring:
        •	Integrate Sentry for error tracking.
        •	Monitor performance and server health.
    2.	Analytics:
